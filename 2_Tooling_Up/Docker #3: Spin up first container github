Docker #3: Spin up first container github

Open Docker:
Click Docker icon and wait for the green light to show that it is running, before you type docker commands in the terminal.

IMAGES:

See your existing images:
Tims-Macbook-Pro-2:~ timbeals$ docker images

Remove an image:
Tims-Macbook-Pro-2:~ timbeals$ docker rmi (image id or repository name)


CONTAINERS:

See if you have any containers running (ps = process status)

Tims-Macbook-Pro-2:~ timbeals$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES

See all containers (running or inactive)
Tims-Macbook-Pro-2:~ timbeals$ docker ps -a

Remove a specific container
Tims-Macbook-Pro-2:~ timbeals$ docker rm (container id)

Remove all containers (active and inactive)
Tims-Macbook-Pro-2:~ timbeals$ docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)



ADDING AN IMAGE:

Go to https://hub.docker.com to find repositories with images.


BUILD AN IMAGE FROM A DOCKER FILE (github)
The docker file is like a config file. It lays out the recipe for creating the image.

we will build the IBM-Swift/Swift-ubuntu-docker image which is located on github
https://github.com/IBM-Swift/swift-ubuntu-docker/blob/master/swift-development/Dockerfile

copy the code in the dockerfile (select "raw") and paste into an empty file (sublime text)
save as Dockerfile

Go to terminal and cd to the dockerfile

build the image: (note that . means at this location)
Tims-Macbook-Pro-2:Kitura_Docker timbeals$ docker build .

add a repository name using the id
Tims-Macbook-Pro-2:Kitura_Docker timbeals$ docker tag (id#) timbeals/ibmcom/ubuntu


spin up a container from the image
Tims-Macbook-Pro-2:Kitura_Docker timbeals$ docker run -itv $(pwd):/root -w /root --name temp_container timbeals/ibmcom-ubuntu /bin/bash


-itv = interactive terminal (or pseudo tty which is the name of a terminal in unix) volume
$(pwd):/root = sets the volume as the present working directory
-w = working directory
/root = sets the working directory to root
--name temp_container = gives the container a name 'temp_container'
timbeals/ibmcom-ubuntu = specifies the image that you want to use
/bin/bash = specify the command to run. This will run bash in our interactive terminal

Now everything that is in the directory of the dockerfile is available in our working linux container.

root@2078b86fd4c9:~# ls
Dockerfile
root@2078b86fd4c9:~# pwd
/root

Stop the container running and return to your mac terminal
root@2078b86fd4c9:~# exit

or stop it from your terminal prompt with
docker stop

Tims-Macbook-Pro-2:Kitura_Docker timbeals$ docker ps (no containers running)
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES

Tims-Macbook-Pro-2:Kitura_Docker timbeals$ docker ps -a (but it is still an available container)
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                    COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS                          PORTS               NAMES
2078b86fd4c9        timbeals/ibmcom-ubuntu   "/bin/bash"         12 minutes ago      Exited (0) About a minute ago                       temp_container


Now you can simply start your existing container. Notice that you return to the mac prompt, but the container is running.
Tims-Macbook-Pro-2:Kitura_Docker timbeals$ docker start temp_container (or use id#)
temp_container

To enter your container in the terminal (you will need to hit enter twice):
Tims-Macbook-Pro-2:Kitura_Docker timbeals$ docker attach temp_container
root@2078b86fd4c9:~#
root@2078b86fd4c9:~#

control p and then control q to leave docker container without turning it off.

to start the container and attach in a single step you can use the -i flag
Tims-Macbook-Pro-2:Kitura_Docker timbeals$ docker start temp_container -i
