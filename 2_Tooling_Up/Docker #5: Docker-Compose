Docker #5: Docker-Compose

In terminal, cd to directory with your .xcodeproj. Create a docker compose file
Tims-Macbook-Pro-2:hello-api timbeals$ nano docker-compose.yml

Add the necessary details to the docker-compose file (look at file)
Note that you cannot use 'tab' in your file creation, only spaces.

  GNU nano 2.0.6           File: docker-compose.yml

app:
  image: ibmcom/swift-ubuntu
  ports:
    - "8080:8080"
  volumes:
    - .:/root/hello-api
  command: bash -c "cd /root/hello-api && swift package clean && swift build &&$


A brief explanation:
we're using the disk image ibmcom/swift-ubuntu
we're mapping the docker container port to the local port 8080
we're mapping our current directory . to the /root/hello-api in the docker container
we're specifying four commands that will be performed one after the other to get the docker container up and running.

To run these commands, make sure that you are in the directory that holds your docker-compose file.

Tims-Macbook-Pro-2:hello-api timbeals$ docker-compose up

Note that you need to stop the xcode if it is already running.

STOP THE CONTAINER
control c (from inside the running container)
or
Tims-Macbook-Pro-2:hello-api timbeals$ docker-compose stop (from a new terminal prompt)
