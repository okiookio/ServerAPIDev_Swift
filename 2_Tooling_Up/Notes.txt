2.3 COMMAND LINE SWIFT

In Terminal
swift --version = check that you have swift on your system
swift = opens the swift REPL read-eval-print-loop (LLVM)

2.4 IBM Swift Sandbox
Online REPL = https://swift.sandbox.bluemix.net/#/repl

2.7 HTTP, WEB FRAMEWORKS, DOCUMENTATION AND RESOURCES.

HTTP = Hypertext Transfer Protocol. The foundation for data communication on the web.
Structured text that used logical links (hyperlinks) between nodes containing text. A protocol to exchange hypertext.

Web Framework = a software framework that is designed to support the development of web applications including web services, web resources and APIs. Web frameworks are aimed to alleviate the overhead associated with common activities performed in web development. They may: provide libraries for database access; templating frameworks; session management; promote code reuse.

For this tutorial we will be using Kitura as our web framework. It was developed by IBM.

2.8 SWIFT PACKAGE MANAGER AND IBM SWIFT PACKAGE CATALOGUE

Swift package manager is included with swift. Initialize a package:

Tims-Macbook-Pro-2:hello-api timbeals$ swift package init --type executable
Creating executable package: hello-api
Creating Package.swift
Creating Sources/
Creating Sources/main.swift
Creating Tests/

Now you can open .main and add your dependencies.

Tims-Macbook-Pro-2:hello-api timbeals$ nano package.swift

Go to https://packagecatalog.com and find the dependencies that you want to work with. In this case we'll user Kitura and Helium Logger. Click the 'Include project in your code' button to save the link. Then in nano...

import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "hello-api",
    dependencies: [
 (paste!!>>>>>) .Package(url: "https://github.com/IBM-Swift/Kitura.git", majorV$
                .Package(url: "https://github.com/IBM-Swift/HeliumLogger.git", $
        ]
)

Get all dependencies and compile into an executable file.

Tims-Macbook-Pro-2:hello-api timbeals$ swift build
***lots of downloads***
Linking ./.build/debug/hello-api


Sources/main.swift is where code execution begins in server side swift.

Tims-Macbook-Pro-2:hello-api timbeals$ .build/debug/hello-api
My first server side swift line of code!





Tims-Macbook-Pro-2:hello-api timbeals$  swift package generate-xcodeproj
generated: ./hello-api.xcodeproj
Tims-Macbook-Pro-2:hello-api timbeals$ ls
Package.swift   Sources     hello-api.xcodeproj
Packages    Tests
Tims-Macbook-Pro-2:hello-api timbeals$ open hello-api.xcodeproj/
