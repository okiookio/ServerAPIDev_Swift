5.31 CouchDB

Kitura has excellent support for couchDB
CouchDB is a NodeSQL Database
Uses javascript views to format data the way you need it.
We will use couchDB within docker.


Find an image with couchDB on Dockerhub
klaemo/couchdb contains the correct version of couchDB 2.0.0

perform a pull from docker hub to get the image onto your local device.
Tims-Macbook-Pro-2:ServerAPIDev_Swift timbeals$ docker pull klaemo/couchdb:2.0.0


Now we need to spin up our own container
Tims-Macbook-Pro-2:ServerAPIDev_Swift timbeals$ docker run --name couch2 -p 5984:5984 -e COUCHDB_USER=tim -e COUCHDB_PASSWORD=123456 klaemo/couchdb:2.0.0

an explanation:
--name couch2 = name the container couch2
-p 5984:5984 = match the docker port to our local port (This port number is provided in the image description on dockerhub)

-e = set environment variables. CouchDB, by default runs in 'admin party mode'. This means that everyone has admin rights. We don't want this. Instead we can setup a single admin user:
-e COUCHDB_USER=tim
-e COUCHDB_PASSWORD=123456
