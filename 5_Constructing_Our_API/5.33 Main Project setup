5.33 Main Project setup

STEPS:
1. CREATE MODULES AND INIT SWIFT PACKAGE
2. PUT DEPENDENCIES IN PACKAGE MANAGER AND BUILD TO DOWNLOAD THEM.
3. HOUSEKEEPING: GITIGNORE, SWIFT-VERSION, CLOUD FOUNDRY IGNORE,
4. DOCKERCOMPOSE FILE
5. MANIFEST FOR BLUEMIX
6. CREATE XCODE PROJ

1. CREATE MODULES
create a main directory with another directory inside it for our kitura project. We will later build the client-side app in the main directory.

Tims-Macbook-Pro-2:ServerAPIDev_Swift timbeals$ mkdir FoodTruck
Tims-Macbook-Pro-2:ServerAPIDev_Swift timbeals$ mkdir FoodTruck/FoodTruckAPI

We will create two modules in our Kitura project
1) FoodtruckAPI - a library or framework
2) FoodtrucksServer - executable

INITIALIZE THE SWIFT PACKAGE TO CREATE THE LIBRARY
Tims-Macbook-Pro-2:FoodTruckAPI timbeals$ swift package init

MOVE INTO SOURCES
Tims-Macbook-Pro-2:FoodTruckAPI timbeals$ cd Sources/
Tims-Macbook-Pro-2:Sources timbeals$ ls
FoodTruckAPI.swift

CREATE TWO NEW DIRECTORIES. ONE FOR THE LIBRARY AND THE OTHER FOR THE EXECUTABLE
Tims-Macbook-Pro-2:Sources timbeals$ mkdir FoodTruckAPI
Tims-Macbook-Pro-2:Sources timbeals$ mkdir FoodTruckServer
Tims-Macbook-Pro-2:Sources timbeals$ ls
FoodTruckAPI    FoodTruckAPI.swift  FoodTruckServer

MOVE THE .SWIFT FILE INTO THE LIBRARY DIRECTORY
Tims-Macbook-Pro-2:Sources timbeals$ mv FoodTruckAPI.swift FoodTruckAPI
Tims-Macbook-Pro-2:Sources timbeals$ ls
FoodTruckAPI  FoorTruckServer

2. ENTER THE PACKAGE MANAGER AND CREATE YOUR TARGETS AND DEPENDENCIES.
Tims-Macbook-Pro-2:FoodTruckAPI timbeals$ nano Package.swift

import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "FoodTruckAPI",
    targets:[
        Target(
        name: "FoodTruckServer",
        dependencies: [.Target(name:"FoodTruckAPI")]
        ),
        Target(
        name: "FoodTruckAPI"
        )
        ],
    dependencies: [
        .Package(url: "https://github.com/IBM-Swift/Kitura.git", majorVersion: 1, minor: 7),
        .Package(url: "https://github.com/IBM-Swift/Kitura-CouchDB.git", majorVersion: 1, minor: 7),
        .Package(url: "https://github.com/IBM-Swift/Swift-cfenv.git", majorVersion: 4, minor: 0),
]
)

NOTES FOR PACKAGE:
NAME - SHOULD MATCH THE DIRECTORY
TARGETS - PARTICULAR CODE THAT YOU ARE GOING TO RUN. NOTICE THAT FOODTRUCK SERVER IS DEPENDENT ON THE FOODTRUCKAPI LIBRARY.
DEPENDENCIES - KITURA IS OUR WEB FRAMEWORK (LIBRARY), COUCHDB IS OUR DATABASE, AND CFENV IS OUR CLOUD FOUNDRY ENVIRONMENT (WHICH ALLOWS OUR SERVER TO COMMUNICATE WITH BLUEMIX LATER). NOTICE ALSO THAT KITURA-COUCHDB INCLUDES HELIUM LOGGER AND SWIFTY JSON.

CREATE A MAIN.SWIFT FOR THE SERVER
This is what differentiates a framework from an executable. The executable must have a main.swift in the module.

Tims-Macbook-Pro-2:Sources timbeals$ cd FoodTruckServer/
Tims-Macbook-Pro-2:FoodTruckServer timbeals$ touch main.swift



BUILD THE PROJECT FROM THE ROOT DIRECTORY

Tims-Macbook-Pro-2:FoodTruckAPI timbeals$ swift build
...

Compile Swift Module 'FoodTruckAPI' (1 sources)
Compile Swift Module 'FoodTruckServer' (1 sources)
Linking ./.build/debug/FoodTruckServer

This will download all of your dependencies and put them into a newly created packages directory. Notice that at the end of the download log you get the confirmation that your FoodTruckAPI and FoodTruckServer are in seperate modules. Notice as well that the execute command is ./.build/debug/FoodTruckServer the directory where you created your main.swift

3. CREATE A SWIFT VERSION FILE

Tims-Macbook-Pro-2:FoodTruckAPI timbeals$ nano .swift-version

This is created in the root directory and includes only one line: 3.1.1. This is the swift version indicated by kitura.


CLOUD FOUNDRY IGNORE

Tims-Macbook-Pro-2:FoodTruckAPI timbeals$ nano .cfignore

.DS_Store = This is something that mac puts in the file system.
.build/* = We will do the build in bluemix so this is not needed
Packages/* = It will grab all of the packages so we don't need to send them up.
*.xcodeproj/* = xcode files are for local use only
*.xcworkspace/* = xcode files are for local use only
couchdb.stdout = These couch db files may be created to test our project locally.
couchdb.stderr = These couch db files may be created to test our project locally.

GIT IGNORE

Tims-Macbook-Pro-2:FoodTruckAPI timbeals$ nano .gitignore

.DS_Store
/.build
/Packages
/*.xcodeproj
/*.xcworkspace

4. DOCKER COMPOSE
Usually you will have several containers for other services like a database, web service, background tasks, etc. For this we use the docker-compose.yml.

db:
  images: klaemo/couchdb:2.0.0
  ports:
    - "5984:5984"
  environment:
    - COUCHDB_USER=Tim
    - COUCHDB_PASSWORD=123456

app:
  image: ibmcom/swift-ubuntu
  ports:
    - "8080:8080"
  volumes:
    - .:/root/FoodTruckAPI
  command: bash -c "cd /root/FoodTruckAPI && swift package clean && swift build --configuration release && ./.build/release/FoodTruckServer"
  links:
    - db:localhost

What's going on here?

We have two containers being built. One is for db and the other is for app. We specify the image that is being used to build each container and then add any additional settings.

db:
image: In the image we have to specify which version we want to use with couchdb. The image has a couple of version options and you can check them out at hub.docker.
ports: We are exposing the container port 5984 to the same port on our local machine
volumes: Mounts the project directory on the host to the /root/FoodTruckAPI of the container.
links: links the app to the db. This means that we can perform the executable on the app and it will load up the db. When we refer to localhost inside the app it will be referring to the db.
A Debug configuration supports the debugging of an app, and a Release configuration builds a version of the app that can be deployed.

5. CREATE A MANIFEST FILE FOR BLUEMIX
This specifies how your local machine will

Tims-Macbook-Pro-2:FoodTruckAPI timbeals$ nano manifest.yml

applications:
- path: .
  memory: 256M
  instances: 1
  domain: mybluemix.net
  name: FoodTruckAPI Server
  host: FoodTruckAPI-Server
  disk_quota: 1024M
  buildpack: swift_buildpack
  command: FoodTruckServer

The 'command: FoodTruckServer' has come from the docker-compose file.


6. CREATE XCODE PROJECT

CREATE XCODEPROJ FILE
Tims-Macbook-Pro-2:FoodTruckAPI timbeals$ swift package generate-xcodeproj

OPEN IT
Tims-Macbook-Pro-2:FoodTruckAPI timbeals$ open FoodTruckAPI.xcodeproj

notice that the two modules that you made (Server and API) are both in the list of sources.
Switch your scheme to FoodTruckServer (remember that this is where you made the main.swift) and build.
