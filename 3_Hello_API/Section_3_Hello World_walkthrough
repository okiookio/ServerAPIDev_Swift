Section 3: Hello World - simplified API walkthrough

Goal:
Build a simplified API with 3 end-points that are get
Return static data
push to bluemix


create directory and cd into it
create swift package
Tims-Macbook-Pro-2:3_Hello_API timbeals$ mkdir hello-api
Tims-Macbook-Pro-2:3_Hello_API timbeals$ cd hello-api/
Tims-Macbook-Pro-2:hello-api timbeals$ swift package init --type executable

open package.swift
Tims-Macbook-Pro-2:hello-api timbeals$ nano Package.swift


Go to swift package catalogue and grab kitura, helium logger, Swift-cfenv and put into dependencies array in package.swift
(Note: Swift-cfenv is related to cloud foundry environment and allows us to access information about our bluemix environment)

import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "hello-api",
    dependencies: [
        .Package(url: "https://github.com/IBM-Swift/Kitura.git", majorVersion: $
        .Package(url: "https://github.com/IBM-Swift/HeliumLogger.git", majorVer$
        .Package(url: "https://github.com/IBM-Swift/Swift-cfenv.git", majorVers$
        ]
)

Grab packages and compile everything.

Tims-Macbook-Pro-2:hello-api timbeals$ swift build

Run main.swift to check that everything works.

Tims-Macbook-Pro-2:hello-api timbeals$ .build/debug/hello-api
Hello, world!

(note: "Hello, world!" is the default code in main.swift)

If you change your dependencies after you have created your xcode project file, you may need to delete it and create it again. In other words, try to plan your dependencies at the very beginning.

Create your xcode project with the swift package manager

Tims-Macbook-Pro-2:hello-api timbeals$ swift package generate-xcodeproj
generated: ./hello-api.xcodeproj

open the xcode project
Tims-Macbook-Pro-2:hello-api timbeals$ open hello-api.xcodeproj/

select the executable type at the top of your xcode project and click run to test that everything builds correctly.
